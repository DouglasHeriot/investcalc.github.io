# Investment Frequency Calculator

https://investcalc.github.io/

This calculator is designed for the situation in which you receive a regular salary (e.g. each fortnight) and set aside some for investing in a parcel of shares. However, if you have to pay brokerage on every parcel then it may be better to keep that money aside in a savings account until you have saved for a larger parcel. Invest too often and you’ll pay too much brokerage. Don’t invest often enough and you’ll miss out on (higher) returns from the market. This calculator is designed to find the optimal frequency to maximise long-term returns based on the input parameters and assumptions.

It uses the technique to solve this problem I wrote on [Money StackExchange](https://money.stackexchange.com/a/30774).
